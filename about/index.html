<div class="blurb">
  <p>I never meant to be a programmer; some things are just meant to be. My Software Engineer Dad strongly encouraged me to
    pursue computers, and I strongly told him I’d never do it.  A few years and a couple majors later, I took an Intro to C
    class and something clicked like never before. Now I’m an engineer as well with rising interests in Human-Computer
    Interaction, UX Design, and Cybersecurity.</p>

  <p>My underlying passion is to help and to teach. My pre-engineering aspirations were first in medicine, then in counseling.
    In four years with the Ballroom Dance Club, I went from having zero knowledge to teaching groups of 50 or more. I taught a
    group of Sophomores how to use git effectively.  And of all my tasks and projects, my favorite have been those that made my
    team’s job easier.</p>

  <p>Robert C. Martin talks about the need for professionalism and craftsmanship in the industry, even going so far as to write
    a <a href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2015/11/18/TheProgrammersOath.html">Programmer’s Oath</a> inspired by the
    Hippocratic oath and ancient scribes. I don’t know if he’s right about what that should look like, but I do believe in being a
    better class of programmer, in learning from those that have come before, and in treating the things I create with the
    respect and wonder they deserve.</p>
